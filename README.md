# ChatBot-for-sustainable-development

 This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to promote awareness, education, and engagement around the  Sustainable Development Goals. The chatbot interacts with users on topics like clean energy, climate action, quality education, and more serving as a virtual advocate for sustainability.


 Given the project from college in Artificial Intelligence subject, we have to make the chat-bot for Sustainable development quiz and answers.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User inputs a query (e.g. “How can I help reduce climate change?”)
2. The bot processes the text and matches it to the relevant SDG.
3. A contextual, educational response is generated and shown.
