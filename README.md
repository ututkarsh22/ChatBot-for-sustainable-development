# ChatBot-for-sustainable-development

 This project is an AI-powered chatbot designed to promote awareness, education, and engagement around the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. The chatbot interacts with users on topics like clean energy, climate action, quality education, and more — serving as a virtual advocate for sustainability.


 Given the project from college in Artificial Intelligence subject, we have to make the chat-bot for Sustainable development quiz and answers.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User inputs a query (e.g. “How can I help reduce climate change?”)
2. The bot processes the text and matches it to the relevant SDG.
3. A contextual, educational response is generated and shown.
